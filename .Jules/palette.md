## 2026-08-07 - Adding Required Indicators to Forms
**Learning:** Found that required input fields in the contact form were missing a visual indicator before submission, despite having the 'required' HTML attribute. This is an accessibility issue because users should not have to attempt form submission to find out which fields are required.
**Action:** Always append an explicit visual indicator (e.g., `<span aria-hidden="true">*</span>`) to labels of required fields, utilizing existing design system classes (like `text-error`).
