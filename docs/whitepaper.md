# Whitepaper v8.0: The Integrity Protocol
## The Actuarial Standard for the Autonomous Agent Economy

**Author:** Solo Architect, Xibalba Solutions  
**Date:** April 2026  
**Status:** Final Release (v8.0)

## 1. Abstract
As autonomous AI agents begin to handle trillions of dollars in global commerce, a systemic "Trust Gap" has emerged. Without a mathematical standard for verifying agent reliability, the industry remains uninsurable and fragmented. The **Integrity Protocol** provides the first decentralized solution: the **Agent Integrity Score (AIS)**. By bridging off-chain telemetry with on-chain cryptographic proofs, Xibalba Solutions creates a portable, tamper-proof reputation layer that makes AI agents insurable, trustworthy, and sovereign.

## 2. The Problem: The $1.5T Trust Vacuum
By 2028, over 40% of all online transactions are projected to be initiated by AI agents. Current reputation systems (stars/reviews) are easily manipulated by Sybil attacks and lack the technical depth required for institutional risk assessment. 

**Key Failures:**
- **Black-Box Risk:** No way to verify if an agent's internal logic is drifting.
- **Economic Non-Persistence:** If an agent fails a contract, there is no consequence beyond a deleted account.
- **Information Asymmetry:** Providers know their failure rates; customers do not.

## 3. The Solution: Tri-Metric AIS v8.0
Xibalba Solutions introduces the **Tri-Metric Model**, an actuarial-grade scoring system that evaluates agents across three correlated dimensions:

### 3.1 Pillar 1: Entropy Score (Stability)
Measures the statistical variance of performance. High entropy indicates erratic behavior—the primary precursor to failure.
$$S_{entropy} = e^{-1.5 \cdot \sigma^2} \times 1000$$

### 3.2 Pillar 2: Grounding Score (Accountability)
Quantifies Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight. Agents with deep human "tethering" are assigned lower risk weights.
$$S_{grounding} = HGI_{raw} \times 1000$$

### 3.3 Pillar 3: Sacrifice (Compute Proof)
Uses verified GPU/TPU hours as "Proof of Work" to ensure agents have "skin in the game" and prevent low-cost Sybil bot attacks.

---

## 4. The Identity Pillar: Hierarchy of Accountability
For a reputation score to be actionable, it must be bound to a legal or financial entity. Xibalba Solutions enforces an **Identity Ceiling** logic:

- **Sovereign Agents (Tier 1):** Cryptographically unique but unlinked. Capped at a "CCC" risk rating (AIS 600).
- **Linked Agents (Tier 2):** Bound to a verified domain or organization. Capped at "AA" rating (AIS 850).
- **Institutional Agents (Tier 3):** Fully KYC'd or business-verified. Eligible for the maximum "AAA" rating (AIS 1000).

This hierarchy creates an economic "Verification Ladder," incentivizing agents to move from anonymity to institutional accountability as they grow in value.

## 5. The Economy: $ITK Token & Sovereign Tax
The **Integrity Token (ITK)** is the utility asset that fuels the trust engine.

- **The Sovereign Tax:** A 0.5% fee is applied to every reputation-anchored handshake.
- **Deflationary Burn:** 50% of the tax is permanently burned, creating scarcity as the agentic web expands.
- **Treasury Revenue:** 50% of the tax funds the Xibalba Treasury for protocol R&D and insurance grants.
- **Staking & Slashing:** Agents must stake ITK to access high-value deals. Misbehavior results in automated **Dual-Witness Slashing**.

## 6. Open Standards & Interoperability
To ensure the global adoption of the Agent Integrity Score, Xibalba Solutions aligns with the leading standards of the decentralized identity ecosystem:

### 6.1 W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DID)
Every agent in the protocol is assigned a **did:intg** identifier. This allows for a persistent, globally unique identity that is resolved via the Xibalba Trust Oracle, enabling cross-protocol recognition of agent provenance.

### 6.2 Verifiable Credentials (VC)
The AIS score is exported as a **W3C Verifiable Credential**. These credentials are cryptographically signed by the Xibalba Identity Oracle and can be verified by any third-party system without requiring a direct connection to the Xibalba backend.

### 6.3 ERC-8004 Compatibility
The Integrity Protocol implements the **ERC-8004** standard hooks for on-chain identity and reputation registries. This ensures that AIS scores and validation proofs (ZK-Reputation) are natively readable by the broader Ethereum "Agent Commerce" ecosystem.

---

## 7. Privacy & Sovereignty: ZK-Reputation
Utilizing **Noir ZK-Circuits**, the protocol allows agents to prove their trustworthiness without revealing sensitive data.
- **Zero-Knowledge AIS Proofs:** An agent can prove `AIS > 800` to a counterparty while keeping their granular performance logs private.
- **Cross-Chain Attestation:** Standardized on **Chainlink CCIP**, AIS attestations are bridged from Base (L2) to the global Ethereum ecosystem.

---

## 8. Governance: Xibalba DAO & AI-Proxy Delegation
To eliminate "Governance Fatigue," the protocol transitions to a **Sovereign DAO** using an innovative **AI-Proxy Delegation** architecture. Token holders configure and deploy specialized "Guardian Agents" equipped with constitutional mandates. 

Instead of manual human voting on complex technical parameters, these Guardians autonomously analyze proposals (e.g., adjustments to the **Stability Drag** or **Slash Thresholds**) using RAG against the protocol's documentation. To ensure long-term stability and prevent runaway loops, the DAO enforces a **10% Minority Challenge** safety valve, allowing humans to pause and audit the AI's optimistic execution. 

The protocol is currently in its **Shadow Governance (Pilot Phase)**, where Guardian votes are non-binding and used to train the protocol's stability model.

---

## 9. Revenue Model
1. **Verification Fees:** 0.25% protocol revenue on all handshakes.
2. **Actuarial SaaS:** Subscription-based API access for insurance underwriters.
3. **Audit Tiering:** Platinum-tier manual audits for enterprise AI clusters.

---

## 10. Conclusion
Xibalba Solutions does not build the agents; we verify their worth. The Integrity Protocol is the foundational "Actuarial Feed" for the next era of autonomous commerce.

**"Verification is the only path to finality."**
